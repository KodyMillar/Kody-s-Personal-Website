        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p align="justify">There are many things I enjoy doing in my free time, and I often try to not
            stay bored even if it means enjoying quiet moments. One of my <em>favorite</em>
            things to do is read books. I like reading all kinds of books, whether it's fiction,
            history, economics, or psychology. One of the <em>best</em> books I've ever read is
            <i>Kafka on the Shore</i>, a magic realism fantasy novel by Haruki Murakami. I also
            enjoy watching shows and movies, or learning new skills such as baking. If I'm not
            at home, I enjoy exercising, going out with friends, or go exploring different areas
            or even travel, things which I also <em>love</em> to do. In terms of my career, 
            <strong>film directing</strong> used to be my goal, but after I realized it really
            wasn't for me, I am now studying IT and trying to make a career change and thinking
            of <strong>software development</strong>. Which means now I also enjoy doing coding
            in my free time as well.
