                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>There are many things I enjoy doing in my free time, and I often try to not
                        stay bored even if it means enjoying quiet moments. One of my <em>favorite</em>
                        things to do is to <strong>read books</strong>. I like reading all kinds of books, whether it's fiction,
                        history, economics, or philosophy. One of the <em>best</em> books I've ever read is
                        <i>Kafka on the Shore</i>, a magic realism fantasy novel by Haruki Murakami. I also
                        enjoy watching shows and movies, or learning new skills such as baking. If I'm not
                        at home, I enjoy exercising, going out with friends, or exploring different areas
                        or even traveling.

                    <h3>Career</h3>
                    <p>  
                        In terms of my career, I had tried different career paths to figure out what I want to do.
                        <strong>Film directing</strong> used to be my goal, but after I realized it really
                        wasn't for me, I am now studying IT and trying to make a career change and thinking
                        of <strong>software development</strong>. Which means now I also enjoy doing coding
                        in my free time as well.
